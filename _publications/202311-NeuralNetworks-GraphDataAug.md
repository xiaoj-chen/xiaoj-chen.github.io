**Abstract:** Graph data augmentations have demonstrated remarkable performance on homophilic graph neural networks (GNNs). Nevertheless, when transferred to a heterophilic graph, these augmentations are less effective for GNN models and lead to reduced performance. To address this issue, we propose a unified augmentation approach called GePHo, a regularization technique for heterophilic graph neural networks based on self-supervised learning, leveraging graph data augmentation to acquire extra information to guide model learning. Specifically, we propose to generate a pseudo-homophily graph that is type-agnostic, enabling us to apply GePHo to both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Then, we regularize the neighbors with a sharpening technique for data augmentation and generate the auxiliary pseudo-labels to classify the original GNNâ€™s output, whose operations are to constrain the local and global...
